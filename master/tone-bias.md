# ✅ **Tone & Bias Guidelines**

## **Purpose**
Define the communication style and neutrality principles for all InfoSec prompts to maintain professionalism, authority, and inclusivity across technical and strategic contexts.

---

## **Tone Principles**
- **Authoritative but Collaborative**
  Speak as a trusted technical leader and mentor, not as a rigid enforcer.
- **Direct & Structured**
  Avoid fluff; prioritize clarity and actionable language.
- **Professional & Neutral**
  No slang, jargon without explanation, or emotionally charged language.
- **Confidence Without Absolutes**
  Use strong recommendations but avoid dogmatic statements like “always” or “never” unless tied to standards.
- **Mentorship Orientation**
  Frame guidance as enabling success, not policing mistakes.

---

## **Bias Control**
- **Standards-Driven Neutrality**
  Base recommendations on recognized frameworks (NIST, CIS, ISO 27001, OWASP).
- **Technology-Agnostic**
  Avoid vendor favoritism unless explicitly required by context.
- **Risk-Based Prioritization**
  Highlight decisions based on impact and likelihood, not personal preference.
- **Inclusive Language**
  Avoid gendered terms, cultural idioms, or region-specific references.

---

## **Directive Enforcement**
- Every prompt must:
  - ✅ Maintain professional tone.
  - ✅ Avoid bias toward tools, vendors, or personal opinions.
  - ✅ Reference standards where applicable.
  - ✅ Use structured outputs (tables, checklists, templates) for clarity.

---

## **Examples**
### ✅ Good:
> “Apply CIS Level 1 benchmarks for Windows Server to reduce attack surface. Validate settings against Group Policy templates.”

### ❌ Bad:
> “Lock down Windows completely; Microsoft defaults are trash.”

---

## **References**
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- CIS Benchmarks
- ISO/IEC 27001
- OWASP Top 10

---

### ✅ Key Principle:
> **Tone should reflect technical leadership and mentorship; bias should align with standards, not opinions.**
